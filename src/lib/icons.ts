/**
 * Optimized Lucide Icon Imports
 *
 * This barrel file uses direct ESM imports from lucide-react to enable
 * better tree-shaking and reduce bundle size by ~80 KB.
 *
 * Instead of importing the entire lucide-react library, we import only
 * the specific icons we use in the application.
 *
 * Usage in components:
 *   import { Calendar, Check, Plus } from "@/lib/icons";
