# Lodash Vulnerability in @boxyhq/saml-jackson

`pnpm audit` reports a moderate severity vulnerability in `lodash` (used by `@boxyhq/saml-jackson`).
Version required: `>=4.17.23`.
Current version in lockfile: `4.17.21`.

This was skipped in `librarian/fix-dependency-vulnerabilities` to focus on the high-severity `tar` vulnerability and avoid unrelated changes.

Action: Add `lodash` override to `package.json` in a separate PR.
```json
"pnpm": {
  "overrides": {
    "lodash": "^4.17.23"
  }
}
```
