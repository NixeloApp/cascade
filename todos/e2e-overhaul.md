# E2E & Screenshot Infrastructure Overhaul

> **Goal:** Unified, reusable E2E infrastructure with consistent `data-testid` usage, shared page objects, and zero duplication between tests and screenshots.

---

## Completed

- **Phase 1** — Deduplicated utils, fixed hydratedMarker bug, consolidated auth helpers
- **Phase 2.1** — `waitUntilReady()` on all 10 page objects
- **Phase 2.2** — Replaced 38 `isXxxUrl()` functions with shared `routePattern()`
- **Phase 3.2** — Two-phase empty state capture, replaced 33 spinner selectors
- **Phase 4.1** — Added 16 TEST_IDs, eliminated all body text probes and querySelectorAll
- **Phase 5** — Default readiness fallback, deleted 10 private functions

---

## Remaining Work

### Data-testid migration (~75% complete in screenshot tool)

**Screenshot tool:** 95 `getByTestId(TEST_IDS)` calls. Remaining 57 `getByText` are mostly appropriate semantic selectors:
- ~25 empty state / validation messages (legitimate `getByText` usage)
- ~10 seeded content text (necessary for seed-specific screenshots)
- ~12 UI section names that could become TEST_IDs (diminishing returns)
- ~10 public page text (no PageHeader, text is appropriate)

Remaining mechanical fixes:
- [ ] Fix 2 raw `page.locator()` calls (`page.locator("a")`, `page.locator("[role='option']")`)
- [ ] Add TEST_IDs for dashboard widgets ("Quick Stats", "Recent Activity") and board toolbar ("Swimlanes", "Properties") if desired

### Page objects — ✅ DONE

All 3 page objects migrated to TEST_IDs:
- ~~`meetings.page.ts`~~ — now uses 7 MEETINGS TEST_IDs
- ~~`invite.page.ts`~~ — now uses INVITE.STATE_SCREEN + INVITE.LOADING
- ~~`workspaces.page.ts`~~ — now uses WORKSPACE.CARD + LOADING.SPINNER + PAGE.HEADER_TITLE

### Phase 3.1: Split monolith (4,544 lines → target <500)

Extracted so far: config (159) + cli (69) + routing (267) + capture (447) + dialog-helpers (161) + readiness (928) = 2,031 lines.

- [x] Extract `takeScreenshot`, hash guards, staging logic into `capture.ts`
- [x] Extract dialog/modal helpers into `dialog-helpers.ts`
- [x] Extract URL pattern map into `routing.ts`
- [x] Extract manifest diff/approve — already in separate `scripts/screenshot-diff.js`
- [x] Extract page readiness helpers + `waitForExpectedContent` into `readiness.ts`
- [ ] Extract `screenshotPublicPages` / `screenshotEmptyStates`
- [ ] Extract `screenshotFilledStates` (1,350 lines — largest remaining block)
- [ ] Extract modal/interactive screenshot captures

### Phase 5: Screenshot tool uses page objects

- [ ] Replace screenshot readiness functions with page object `waitUntilReady()` calls
- [ ] Create missing page objects: InvoicesPage, ClientsPage, TimeTrackingPage, AnalyticsPage, NotificationsPage, RoadmapPage, ActivityPage, BillingPage, TimesheetPage, MembersPage, BacklogPage, SprintsPage

### Phase 6: CI integration

- [ ] Add validator that counts private functions in screenshot tool
- [ ] Ensure `check-test-ids.js` validator covers screenshot tool
- [ ] Consider splitting screenshot capture across CI workers

## Current Stats

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| File lines | 5,292 | 3,203 |
| Private functions | 134 | ~50 |
| TEST_ID usage | 64 | 95 |
| Fragile selectors | ~150 | 57 (mostly appropriate getByText) |
| TEST_IDs defined | 181 | 203 |
| Page objects at 0 TEST_IDs | 3 | 0 |
| Duplicate helpers | 6 | 0 |
| body.innerText probes | 15 | 0 |

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `screenshot-pages.ts` under 500 lines
- [ ] 0 private readiness functions in screenshot tool
- [ ] TEST_IDs coverage: 250+ (currently 197)
- [ ] Screenshot capture completes for all 4 configs
- [ ] E2E specs and screenshots share identical page objects
