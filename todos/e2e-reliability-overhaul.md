# E2E Reliability Overhaul

> **Priority:** P0 (Highest)
> **Effort:** Large
> **Status:** In Progress (local full-suite now green; hardening work remains)
> **Last Updated:** 2026-03-06

## Objective

Make E2E tests deterministic and locally verifiable with one rule: run the full suite and check pass/fail. No summary jobs, no history-derived gates.

## Baseline Rule

- Source of truth is local full run output from:
  - `pnpm exec playwright test --reporter=line`
- Acceptance signal is binary:
  - `100% pass` or `not 100% pass`

## Hard Rules

- [x] No fixed sleep waits (`waitForTimeout`) except explicitly justified polling edge cases.
- [ ] Await specific UI state changes (`toBeVisible`, `toHaveText`, `toHaveURL`, `toHaveCount`) tied to user outcomes.
- [ ] Prefer semantic/role selectors and stable test ids over brittle CSS/text fallbacks.
- [ ] Every critical user action must wait for one deterministic completion signal.
- [ ] Any flaky test fix must include root-cause notes and a guard assertion preventing regression.

## Workstreams

### 1) Failure Triage

- [x] Bucket failures into: selector drift, async race, data setup instability, auth/session, backend latency.
- [x] Maintain per-spec failure heatmap from latest local run artifacts.
- [x] Prioritize top failing specs first.

### 2) Waiting Strategy Refactor

- [x] Replace weak waits with state-based helpers:
  - `waitForDashboardReady`
  - `waitForBoardLoaded`
  - `waitForIssueCreateSuccess`
  - `waitForOAuthRedirectComplete`
- [ ] Standardize pattern: action -> await deterministic state -> assert outcome.
- [ ] Remove redundant retries masking race conditions.

### 3) Data Isolation

- [ ] Ensure each spec has isolated data namespace and idempotent setup.
- [ ] Strengthen cleanup for test artifacts/users to prevent cross-test contamination.
- [ ] Add backend health precheck in setup with explicit failure reason when unavailable.

### 4) Selector Contract Stabilization

- [ ] Audit unstable selectors and replace with:
  - `getByRole`
  - `getByLabel`
  - `getByTestId(TEST_IDS...)`
- [ ] Expand `TEST_IDS` constants where critical flows lack stable anchors.
- [x] Document selector hierarchy for E2E authoring.

### 5) Suite Controls

- [ ] Keep `forbidOnly` and strict no-skip policy for critical path specs.
- [ ] Remove unnecessary retries in critical-path specs.
- [ ] Enforce deterministic waits in all modified/new specs.

### 6) Passing-Test Hardening

- [ ] Review currently passing core specs and refactor weak waits preemptively.
- [ ] Apply shared helper abstractions to reduce copy/paste anti-patterns.
- [x] Add reliability checklist to PR review for E2E file changes.

## Phase Plan

### Phase 1 (S1): Stability Foundation

- [ ] Fix top failing specs and drive local full-suite to consistent green runs.
- [ ] Land waiting helper rollout across highest-risk specs.

### Phase 2 (S2): Determinism

- [ ] Refactor all critical-path specs to state-driven awaits.
- [ ] Eliminate flaky selector and race-condition hotspots.

### Phase 3 (S3): Sustainment

- [ ] Proactively modernize remaining passing specs.
- [ ] Keep full local suite green across repeated runs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] No unjustified `waitForTimeout` usage across E2E suite.
- [x] Full local suite run reports 100% pass.
- [ ] Core flows (`auth`, `issue create/edit`, `board drag/drop`, `docs`, `search`) are stable.
- [ ] E2E authoring standard is documented and enforced in reviews.

## Remaining Work (Execution Backlog)

This is the concrete "what's left" list for reliability hardening after the latest green full-suite run.

1. Deterministic post-action assertions in critical flows:
   - convert any remaining action-only steps into `action -> deterministic wait -> outcome assert`.
   - `createIssue()` now owns modal-close/success completion, and duplicate modal-close waits were removed from touched consumers.
   - issue title edit guards now cover both the detail modal and the direct issue page route.
   - issue description/priority edit guards now cover both the detail modal and the direct issue page route.
   - issue-detail dialog close assertions now go through `ProjectsPage.closeIssueDetail()` in the touched modal consumers.
   - next target: remaining repeated dialog-open expectations and non-project modal close patterns in other specs/page objects.
2. Selector contract completion:
   - `pnpm run validate` now passes with no `Test ID constants` warnings.
   - continue replacing brittle text/CSS fallbacks opportunistically when modifying critical specs.
   - add missing `TEST_IDS` constants only where critical controls still lack stable anchors.
3. Data isolation and cleanup hardening:
   - ensure per-spec unique namespaces for created entities.
   - guarantee teardown paths for users/projects/issues created during tests.
4. Suite policy enforcement:
   - remove unnecessary retries in critical-path specs.
   - keep no-skip/no-only audits clean for critical path at commit time.
5. Evidence updates after every full run:
   - append the latest pass/fail outcome and duration in this file.
   - record failing spec names and immediate next action when the suite is not 100% pass.

## Current Hardening Notes

- Project-tab navigation is scoped to the project tab strip to avoid collisions with global navigation links.
- `createProject()` now retries `click -> /projects/[KEY]/board` to absorb modal/hydration redirect races.
- `createProject()` now scopes to the active project modal, waits for modal-close plus success toast, and falls back to direct board navigation when the client-side redirect lags after a confirmed create.
- Issue-detail URL specs now read the issue key from `TEST_IDS.ISSUE.KEY` via `ProjectsPage`, not by parsing the card `aria-label`.
- `createIssue()` owns the completion signal, so touched specs now assert the user-visible outcome instead of re-checking modal closure.
- Issue metadata edit coverage now uses stable detail selectors for description content and case-insensitive priority assertions, so the modal test guards both persistence and UI presentation without brittle text casing.
- Standalone issue-detail route interactions now go through `IssueDetailPage`, so direct-route specs no longer reach into `getByTestId()` from the spec body for description edit assertions.
- Issue-detail modal close flows now go through `ProjectsPage.closeIssueDetail()`, so touched specs do not inline `Escape` plus dialog-hidden waits after edits.

## Evidence Freshness Guard

Full-suite evidence in this TODO is considered stale if older than 24 hours.

- If stale, do not treat `Full local suite run reports 100% pass` as release-gate evidence.
- Refresh by rerunning:
  - `pnpm exec playwright test --reporter=line`
- Then update:
  - `Last Updated`
  - latest run outcome, duration, and skip count
  - immediate next action when not 100% pass

## Latest Verified Full-Suite Evidence

- Run command:
  - `pnpm exec playwright test --reporter=line`
- Run date:
  - `2026-03-06`
- Outcome:
  - `155 passed (5.9m)`, `0 skipped`
- Gate interpretation:
  - current local suite is green; refresh is required when evidence is older than 24 hours (see `Evidence Freshness Guard`).
