# Feature Comparison: cal.com vs plane vs Cascade

## Objective

Compare UI/UX implementation of features across three codebases:
- **cal.com** (`~/Desktop/cal.com`) — scheduling/booking platform
- **plane** (`~/Desktop/plane`) — project management (issues, cycles, modules)
- **Cascade** (`~/Desktop/cascade`) — our app (issues, projects, sprints, docs)

**Goal:** Identify what we have, what they have, and how our UI/UX can improve.

## Document Format (per feature)

Each `.md` file should follow this structure:

```markdown
# [Feature Name]

## Overview
Brief description of what this feature does.

---

## cal.com
> Skip if feature doesn't exist in cal.com

### Trigger
- How user initiates this feature (button location, keyboard shortcut, etc.)

### UI Elements
- Modals, dropdowns, forms, sidebars involved
- List each field/input with type and validation

### Flow
1. Step-by-step user interaction
2. Include clicks, selections, form fills
3. Note loading states, transitions

### Feedback
- Toasts, success messages, error handling
- Redirects, UI updates

---

## plane
> Skip if feature doesn't exist in plane

[Same structure as above]

---

## Cascade
> Our implementation

[Same structure as above]

## Comparison Table

| Aspect | cal.com | plane | Cascade | Best |
|--------|---------|-------|---------|------|
| Keyboard shortcut | — | ✅ `C` | ❌ | plane |
| Inline editing | — | ✅ | ⚠️ partial | plane |
| Bulk actions | — | ✅ | ✅ | tie |
| ... | | | | |

## Recommendations

1. **Priority 1:** [Specific improvement for Cascade]
2. **Priority 2:** [Another improvement]
3. ...

## Execution Instructions

1. **Start with README.md** — Create index of all features to analyze
2. **Work through categories** — One category at a time (issues, projects, etc.)
3. **For each feature:**
   - Read the source code in all 3 repos
   - Document the UI/UX flow in detail
   - Create comparison table
   - Write recommendations
4. **Update README.md** — Mark features as ✅ done
5. **Commit progress** — After each category is complete

## Progress Tracking

- [x] README.md created
- [ ] scheduling/ (cal.com focus)
- [x] issues/ (plane + Cascade focus)
- [x] projects/
- [x] sprints-cycles/

## Notes

- cal.com is primarily scheduling — many features won't apply
- plane is closest competitor — prioritize comparing with plane
- Focus on UI/UX quality, not just feature existence
- "We have it but worse" is valid finding — document HOW it's worse
