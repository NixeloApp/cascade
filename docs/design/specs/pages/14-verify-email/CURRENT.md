## Summary

The verify-email page is completely missing. After a user submits their email for magic link authentication, there's no confirmation page telling them to check their inbox. This is a significant UX gap - users are left wondering if anything happened.

**Required flow:**
1. User enters email → submits
2. Redirect to `/verify-email?email=user@example.com`
3. Show "Check your inbox" message with email displayed
4. Provide "Resend" button with rate limiting
5. Provide "Use different email" link back to signin
