# Authentication Pages - Current State

> **Routes**: `/signin` and `/signup`
> **Status**: IMPLEMENTED
> **Last Updated**: 2026-03-22

---

## Purpose

The authentication pages handle user sign-in and sign-up with email/password and Google OAuth. They answer:

- How do I sign in to an existing account?
- How do I create a new account?
- Does my organization use Google Workspace SSO?
- How do I verify my email after signing up?
- Where do I go if I forgot my password?

## Current Composition Walkthrough

### Sign In (`/signin`)

1. **Route**: 25-line thin route. Wraps `SignInForm` in `AuthRedirect` and `AuthPageLayout`.
2. **AuthRedirect**: Checks `api.auth.getRedirectDestination`. If the user is already authenticated, redirects to dashboard or onboarding. Always renders children to avoid unmounting forms during auth transitions.
3. **AuthPageLayout**: Two-column layout on xl screens. Left panel shows a product showcase (NixeloLogo, headline, three rail points: Capture, Coordinate, Deliver). Right panel contains the form shell. On mobile, only the form shell is shown with a compact logo.
4. **SignInForm**: Progressive disclosure pattern:
   - Initially shows Google OAuth button and a "Continue with email" button (secondary variant).
   - Clicking "Continue with email" animates open the email + password fields.
   - Form supports SSO discovery: as the user types their email, `api.sso.getForDomain` checks if the domain has Google Workspace SSO. If so, the Google button text changes and password sign-in is blocked.
   - Submit calls `@convex-dev/auth` `signIn("password", formData)` with `flow: "signIn"`.
   - On success, navigates to `ROUTES.app.path`.
5. **Hydration safety**: Hidden `data-testid` markers track `hydrated` and `formReady` states for E2E testing. The submit button is disabled until hydrated.

### Sign Up (`/signup`)

1. **Route**: 44-line route with search parameter validation. Supports `?step=verify&email=...` for deep-linking to the verification step (used by screenshot tooling).
2. **SignUpForm**: Three-step flow:
   - **Step 0**: Google OAuth button and "Continue with email" (same progressive disclosure as sign-in).
   - **Step 1**: Email + password fields with `PasswordStrengthIndicator` that analyzes password strength in real-time. `AuthStepIndicator` shows progress. Submit calls `signIn("password", formData)` with `flow: "signUp"`, which triggers email verification.
   - **Step 2 (verification)**: `EmailVerificationForm` with OTP code input. On success, navigates to `ROUTES.app.path`.
3. **initialVerificationEmail**: The route can pre-populate the verification step via URL search params, enabling screenshot capture of the verification UI.

### Shared Components

- **AuthPageLayout**: Full-page layout with gradient background, showcase panel, and form shell. Uses `Card` recipe classes for panel styling.
- **GoogleAuthButton**: Calls `signIn("google")` via `@convex-dev/auth`. Shows Google logo SVG with brand-colored paths. Feature-flagged via `api.featureFlags.isGoogleAuthEnabled` -- shows "temporarily unavailable" when disabled.
- **AuthMethodDivider**: Visual "or" divider between OAuth and email sign-in.
- **AuthLink/AuthLinkButton**: Styled link for "Sign up" / "Sign in" cross-navigation and "Forgot password?" action.
- **AuthStepIndicator**: Step progress dots for the sign-up flow.

## Current Problems

| # | Problem | Area | Severity |
|---|---------|------|----------|
| 1 | No screenshot coverage for the sign-up route (only sign-in is captured in this spec's screenshot dir) | testing | MEDIUM |
| 2 | The progressive disclosure animation uses `max-h-48` / `max-h-64` arbitrary values for expand/collapse | styling | LOW |
| 3 | SSO discovery fires a query on every keystroke as the user types their email domain | performance | LOW |
| 4 | The AuthShowcasePanel left-column content (Capture/Coordinate/Deliver rail points) is static marketing copy that may not match the current product | content | LOW |
| ~~5~~ | ~~Fragile hydrated + formReady two-phase approach~~ **Fixed** — removed both states, microtask scheduling, and FORM_HYDRATED marker. FORM_READY renders when email form is visible. Validation moved to submit handler. | ~~architecture~~ | ~~MEDIUM~~ |
| 6 | Error messages from `submitPasswordSignIn` are generic ("Could not sign in. Please check your credentials.") -- no specific guidance for common failures | UX | LOW |
| 7 | The `ssr: false` route option disables server-side rendering entirely for auth pages | performance | LOW |
