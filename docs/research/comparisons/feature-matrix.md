   - No invoicing (Kimai has this)

### Opportunities 🌟

1. **"Open-source Notion + Linear" Positioning**
   - Growing demand for Notion alternatives (AppFlowy proves this)
   - Linear is paid-only, expensive
   - Position as "Linear for teams who want open-source"

2. **Developer Community**
   - Developers hate Jira/Confluence
   - Love modern stacks (Cal.com/AppFlowy success proves this)
   - API-first = developer love

3. **Privacy/Data Sovereignty Trend**
   - Companies want self-hosting (GDPR, compliance)
   - AppFlowy/Kimai show demand
   - "Your data, your server" messaging

4. **AI Integration**
   - All competitors adding AI (AppFlowy, Canvas)
   - Opportunity to build AI-first features
   - Convex makes this easy

### Threats ⚠️

1. **Established Competitors**
   - Linear has mind-share, funding, team
   - Notion has massive user base
   - Jira/Confluence have enterprise lock-in

2. **Fast-growing Open Source**
   - Cal.com raised $32M
   - AppFlowy has 400 contributors
   - Hard to compete with funded teams

3. **Market Saturation**
   - "Another project management tool"
   - Hard to differentiate
   - Users fatigued by new tools

4. **Convex Dependency**
   - Tied to Convex platform
   - If Convex pivots/raises prices, problems
   - Not 100% self-hostable (Convex runs the DB)

## 📈 Learning from Competitors

### What Cal.com Did Right (apply to Nixelo)

1. **Developer-first marketing**
   - "API-driven", "Self-hostable", "Open-source"
   - Resonated with devs
   - Nixelo should do this too

2. **Clear positioning**
   - "Open-source Calendly alternative"
   - Simple, memorable
   - Nixelo = "Open-source Linear + Notion for teams"

3. **Active community engagement**
   - 772 contributors!
   - Responsive to issues/PRs
   - Nixelo needs to welcome contributors

4. **Open core model**
   - 99% free, 1% enterprise = perfect balance
   - Users feel good, enterprises pay
   - Nixelo should copy this exactly

### What AppFlowy Did Right

1. **Privacy narrative**
   - "100% control of your data"
   - "No vendor lock-in"
   - Nixelo should emphasize self-hosting

2. **Notion alternative positioning**
   - Clear target (Notion users)
   - Feature parity focus
   - Nixelo = "Jira + Confluence alternative"

3. **Cross-platform from day 1**
   - Flutter made this possible
   - Mobile = huge advantage
   - Nixelo should prioritize mobile (PWA first, native later)

4. **Fast iteration**
   - Weekly releases
   - Community feature requests
   - Nixelo should ship fast

### What Kimai Did Right

1. **Niche focus**
   - Best time tracking for agencies
   - Not trying to be everything
   - Nixelo should own "real-time team collaboration"

2. **Plugin ecosystem**
   - Paid plugins = revenue
   - Community extensions
   - Nixelo could add plugin system (Phase 3)

3. **Affordable SaaS**
   - €5/user/month is accessible
   - Competes with paid tools
   - Nixelo should price similarly ($8-12/user)

**Insight:**
Nixelo is the **only tool** that natively bridges the gap between _meeting data_ and _project execution_. Competitors create "data islands" where meeting notes live separately from the work.

**Note:** Use the competitor-specific docs in `docs/research/competitors/meeting-ai/` as
the canonical source when this matrix compresses plan details. tl;dv paid pricing remains
unverified locally, so the matrix intentionally avoids exact dollar figures there.
